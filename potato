in this video I'm going to teach you guys how to prune your potatoes why you should prune the plant and give you guys some really good tips some growing potatoes right at home so real quick this is a five gallon grown bags one thing about potatoes guys you have to remember we don't eat this part the potato grows on the bottom where the roots are so as you guys could see how the roots grow there that's what we have to cover so as the potato plant is growing you need to cover here with more soil so that more potatoes will come if your potatoes are start growing flowers easy as soon as you see the buds pull out the buds don't even give the plant a chance to grow flowers because as soon as you let this plant grow flowers it's going to basically use all the energy most of the energy to produce and grow that flowers and which slowing the process down in your potatoes so we don't care about flowers we don't care about a lot of leaves you're gonna remember if you're grown in a container in a bag you have to prune out some of this Leaf so we could get air flow and the plant is not just using you know all the energy just to grow leaves we don't need to leave guys so we're going to prune out some of the leaves add some soil so this way our potato plant will push more energy in the bottom which to the roots so you could see our potato plant is about 10 inches high this is perfect to start pruning so what are you going to do we have multiple leaves we're just gonna prune up to where we're gonna add soil or even a little bit higher look like these bottom leaves you could pinch these little ones out look literally I'm pinching them out you could just pinch them out if you you don't want to pinch them out you could always get a pruner and just kind of remove all the little ones look at this little one didn't get a chance to grow but the plant is going to use more energy to grow them so we're gonna prune all them out remove all the bottom leaves guys don't be afraid to do this and as I told you this would help the potato like over to the bottom if you know you could just get a pruner and then remove them at last so by doing this again I'm telling you now the plant is going to use more energy instead of keeping these leaves alive or growing more leaves or grow them even bigger now the plant's gonna not use all that energy on these leaves unnecessary leaves and now we could get a you know faster Harvest this way a bigger Harvest our potatoes gonna be big you know there's a lot a lot of time when you harvest potatoes some people have a couple of you know a couple of the big ones but most of their potatoes are babies are really small see the rule there so we're going to cover that back those roots so you're going to remember one of the reason why you have more baby potatoes it's because the plant is using more energy to grow leaves and then to produce flowers and remember the best sign or the best time when to harvest your potato which is the best sign is when your potato plant grow like at least three four feet and the plant on the top is already like dying once it's already drying and dying from the top it's a sign indication your potatoes are ready hi pepper everybody said hi to Pepper there he's ready so and there's my two little ones coming around in the garden area yep I have a full house here guys don't mind me guys I'm not doing anything here and there's my other dog back there so it's always a full house in Green Tea Garden so this is a new section coming up here we don't need it because we already have the main stem coming up so we don't need that don't be afraid this is a new single one we're gonna leave that it's gonna give us more potato plant but if you see any like branches coming out from the side extra prune them out don't be afraid guys you're not gonna hurt your potato plant remember we don't we don't need the leaves you could prune all the way up and just leave there look this whole look at this one here I'm just gonna shoot I prune all the way up and it's left that whatever so after pruning everything out look at your plant prune everything out and you see these roots right here we have to cover them okay so got some compost and soil and I could still see my kids I'm thrown in uh eggshell without crushing it up for me so what we're gonna do we're gonna fill it about cup two inches high so we cover all the roots and everywhere and as the bat as you're you're adding more soil you could always unfold these bags put some of the dirt between of all the stem on the plant because you want to cover all and by adding compost it's going to give a big boost guys if you don't have compost uh get some kind of organic fertilizer or go to your local store or Amazon and buy any uh organic uh soil that has like you know most fresh soil organic fresh soil has like some kind of fertilizer or has just helped really healthier you need a big boost of fertilizer or a compost guys when you're growing potatoes if not you're gonna end up with baby potatoes I don't want to spend all this time to grow potatoes and then when you grow you finally have like four big ones but then all the rest are so small so as you guys could see I'm filling it up but I'm not going too high to cover any leaves on the top my soil and compost is moist so I do not have to water it if you guys um just added fresh soil and it's dry sorry about the camera uh you guys could go ahead and water your plant when it's in the growing bags you don't need to water that often if it's not hot you could water every uh four days four or five days is good another tip guys when they're growing flowers be careful the flowers especially uh it's kind of like you know so they said it's a little poisonous when it comes down to human or pets and stuff like that and if you have you know bunnies around your Wildlife or you have dogs cats you want to make sure you don't let them have it so from Italy get rid of the flowers guys so you could see simple thing what I did uh pruning pruning as I said again guys pruning help uh you get more airflow and inside the plant using more energy towards growing leaves it will put more energy to grow the potatoes on the bottom because that's what we need so follow these tips guys if you have any questions please comment below green tea garden love to answer your question so if
